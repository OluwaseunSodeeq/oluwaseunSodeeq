      text: `After a couple of weeks of frustration, you'll give 
  up," said a friend. My journey started miles away from lines 
  of code, deep within the bustling world of a factory worker 
  (warehouse clerk, to be precise). While my days were filled with 
  packing and shipping finished goods, my nights were fueled by a 
  burning passion for web development. Every spare moment was spent 
  glued to online tutorials, devouring documentation, and building 
  projects I found interesting. It wasn't easy â€“ the learning 
  curve was steep, the resources endless, especially because I 
  didn't know exactly what I needed. There were late nights 
  debugging code, moments of frustration when things wouldn't 
  work, and the constant struggle to balance my day job with my 
  learning. But I persevered, overcame each hurdle, and my skills 
  grew.`,

      text: `Driven by a thirst for knowledge, I actively participated in 
  online courses across platforms like FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, Coursera 
  (anchored meta), InstinctHub, and Tiidelab. This diverse learning 
  experience not only broadened my skillset in the basics of web 
  development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also 
  advanced skills like React, Tailwind, and VCS (Git). My learning 
  journey is validated by building projects and earning certificates 
  of completion, which solidify my proficiency in web development.`,
